# MODIS Mosaic Batch Processing
## Introduction
The function of this program is putting the MODIS images of one day togather and making geometric correction of them.
At last, we make the images od the same days joint and combine with 16 bands of radiance by the file names and mask by ocean, land or cloud.
## MODIS DATA
MODIS is a kind of remote sensor on the satellite Terra(Morning satellite) and Aqua(Afternoon satellite) whose revisit period is one day.
## Method
Python code showing.
## Result
As we can see, following image is the mosaic image masking by ocean.
